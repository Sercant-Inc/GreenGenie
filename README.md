The Green Genie project is an application designed for those who are conscious about saving in one way or another, whether for economic or environmental reasons, or both. This application aims to allow the user to set real savings goals by using data provided by the user. Our genie will give you some tips on how to achieve this savings, but of course, fulfilling them is up to the user.

You can also see a comparison of your personal consumption compared to general average consumption to see if you are within normal, above or below.
In the application, we find a welcome splash screen that will appear before we register or log in with our email.
Once we register, the interface takes us to a screen where we find our green genie who will give us some tips as we tap the screen.
We can navigate by swiping the screen or tapping the bottom menu bar to access other screens.
The next screen shows us all the user data and allows us to enter a photo from our gallery and set it as a profile picture.
The next menu shows a graph once we have completed the form data and allows us to set the savings goal.
Finally, we find the screen that allows us to enter data in the form to be able to work with it and set the goals.

The entire interface has been designed to be as comfortable and intuitive as possible and to provide a good user experience. Additionally, it aims to challenge the user to set a savings goal and raise awareness of a more environmentally respectful consciousness.
